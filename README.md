Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I am passionate about math and excited to use my knowledge and skills in real-world applications. I graduated from the New Mexico State University with a degree in Mathematics, where I developed a strong foundation in calculus, algebra, and statistics.

I am constantly seeking to improve my skills and learn new techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate and work on new projects. Thank you for taking the time to visit my GitHub page, and feel free to reach out to me @ "yumimaharjan14@gmail.com" if you have any questions or if you are interested in collaborating on a project!
